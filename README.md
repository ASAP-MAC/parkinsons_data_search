# parkinsonsMetagenomicData
This repository keeps track of the datasets found in the literature and the efforts to obtain them. So far, I found the following datasets that could be of interests for the ASAP microbiome analytics core. The strategy to find them so far was to review the results of the following [Google scholar search](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=it&as_sdt=0,33&q=“metagenomic*”+AND+"parkinson*"). In the future, a double check by other researchers on different paper browsers (e.g. `Scopus`, `WebOfScience`) would strengthen the systematicity.


# Metadata request attempts

So far, the request of metadata has been piloted on only 3 research groups, with no success. I sent the emails from my private email account, Cc-ing Levi, to the corresponding author, and when not the same, to the last author too. This was the email template, which I adapted to each specific case:

```
Dear <corresponding author>,

I am writing on behalf of the Curated Metagenomic Data (cMD) project (Pasolli et al., 2017) led by prof Levi Waldron.
We are currently working on a new data release focused on Parkinson’s disease in a project funded by the "Aligning Science Across Parkinson" (ASAP) network and the Michael J. Fox foundation.

We appreciated reading your contribution in <Journal Name> this year (<doi link>) and for making the sequencing data publicly available. We would like to include your data set in our next cMD release. To do so, we would need have access to individual level metadata. The bare minimum is disease/health status, but age and sex are important as well.

Ideally, it would be best if you could provide us with the full data set you worked with, both for the sake of completeness, reusability, and reproducibility of data, not to mention the higher visibility your contribution would gain.

I am looking forward to discussing the details together.

Best regards
Giacomo Antonello, PhD
